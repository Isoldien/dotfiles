# Isoldien's Dotfiles

## Installation
If you wish to use these dotfiles, then clone the repository to a directory such as `~/Projects/dotfiles` 

```git clone https://github.com/Isoldien/dotfiles/ ~/Projects/dotfiles && cd ~/Projects/dotfiles```

and then copy the directories to your home folder or .config folder

There is no installation script as of right now, maybe I'll create one as I customise Linux more and have more dotfiles where copying directories becomes a hassle
